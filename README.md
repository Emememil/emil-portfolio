Emil's Front-End Developer Portfolio

🚀 Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my skills and projects as an aspiring Front-End Web Developer. Built with HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript, it features a clean, responsive design and highlights my ability to create interactive and user-friendly web applications.

As a final semester BCA student, I'm passionate about learning and applying web technologies to build practical tools. I'm actively improving my skills through hands-on projects and looking for opportunities to contribute to real-world web products in a collaborative environment.

✨ Features

Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless viewing across various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

Project Showcase: A dedicated section to display my key front-end projects with links to their live demos and GitHub repositories.

Skill Highlight: Clearly outlines my technical proficiencies in core web technologies.

Contact Form: An easy way for visitors to get in touch. (Note: This form requires integration with a backend service like Formspree or Netlify Forms to send messages.)

Clean & Modern UI: Focus on a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5: For structuring the content of the web pages.

CSS3: For styling and layout, including responsive design principles.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For adding interactivity and dynamic functionalities to the projects.
